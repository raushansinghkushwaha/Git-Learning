<!-- FlexBOX 
Main Axis: The primary axis along which flex items are placed 
(horizontal by default). 
Cross Axis: The perpendicular axis to the main axis (vertical by 
default). 
1:flex-direction 
row  : Default; items align horizontally from left  to right. 
row-reverse  : Items align horizontally from right  to left. 
column  : Items align vertically from top to bottom. 
column-reverse  : Items align vertically from bottom  to top. 
2: justify-content 
flex-start  : Items align to the start of the container. 
flex-end  : Items align to the end of the container. 
center  : Items are centered along the main axis. 
space-between  : Items are spaced with equal space 
between, but no space at the edges. 
space-around  : Items are spaced with equal space  around 
them. 
space-evenly  : Items have equal space between and  around 
them. 
3: align-items 
flex-start  : Aligns items to the start of the cross axis. 
flex-end  : Aligns items to the end of the cross axis. 
center  : Centers items along the cross axis. 
stretch  : Stretches items to fill the container along  the cross 
axis (default). 
baseline  : Aligns items based on their text baseline. 
4:flex-wrap 
nowrap  : All items stay on a single line (default). 
wrap  : Items wrap onto multiple lines from top to  bottom. 
wrap-reverse  : Items wrap onto multiple lines from  bottom to 
top. 
5: align-content 
The  align-content  property in flexbox is essential  for 
managing how multiple rows of items are aligned within a flex 
container, especially when there is extra space on the cross-axis. 
flex-start  ,  flex-end  ,  center  ,  space-between  , 
space-around  ,  space-evenly  . 
6: Flex Items 
1: order: The  order  property controls the visual  order of flex 
items within a flex container.  Default  :  order: 0; 
2:flex-grow:  The flex-grow property defines how much a flex 
item should grow relative to other items when extra space is 
available in the flex container. Default: flex-grow: 0; 
3: flex-shrink: The  flex-shrink  property  defines how much a 
flex item should shrink relative to other items when the container 
is too small to fit all items at their initial size.  Default  : 
flex-shrink: 1; 
4: The  flex-basis  property sets the initial size of  a flex item 
before any extra space is distributed or the item is allowed to 
grow or shrink.  flex-basis: auto;  (Uses the item’s  content 
size, or width/height if explicitly set.) 
5. align-self: The  align-self  property allows you  to override the 
align-items  property for a specific flex item. This  means each 
item can have its own cross-axis alignment (e.g., vertical 
alignment if  flex-direction: row  ), even if the container  has 
a global alignment rule.  -->
